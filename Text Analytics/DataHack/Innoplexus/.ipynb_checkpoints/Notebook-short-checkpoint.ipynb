    "Nowadays the narrative of a brand is not only built and controlled by the company that owns the brand. For this reason, companies are constantly looking out across Blogs, Forums, and other social media platforms, etc for checking the sentiment for their various products and also competitor products to learn how their brand resonates in the market. This kind of analysis helps them as part of their post-launch market research. This is relevant for a lot of industries including pharma and their drugs.\n",

    "*Stelara is still fairly new to Crohn's treatment. This is why you might not get a lot of replies. I've done some research, but most of the \"time to work\" answers are from Psoriasis boards. For Psoriasis, it seems to be about 4-12 weeks to reach a strong therapeutic level. The good news is, Stelara seems to be getting rave reviews from Crohn's patients. It seems to be the best med to come along since Remicade. I hope you have good success with it. My daughter was diagnosed Feb. 19/07, (13 yrs. old at the time of diagnosis), with Crohn's of the Terminal Illium. Has used Prednisone and Pentasa.

It goes : “Lesions at C2-3 and T2 now show hypointensity on the post gadolinium T1 images only. This could represent artifact or early axonal loss.” That was bothersome to read.

       "4  Hi everybody, My latest MRI results for Brain and Cervical Cord are in and my next Neurologist appointment is in the next couple of weeks. There’re no new lesions in Brain/Cord and I’ve had no relapses while I was on Gilenya. This was a good sign. But there was one line in the cervical cord review that concerned me. It goes : “Lesions at C2-3 and T2 now show hypointensity on the post gadolinium T1 images only. This could represent artifact or early axonal loss.” That was bothersome to read. What are the kind of symptoms from C2-C3 lesion should I be aware of ? Would it result in change of my DMT ? Thanks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

There so much still to do before this is convincing. I hope that it does work out, I really do. And if you’re aware of and happy with the risks, then that’s great. I just think it’s important to present this in a balanced way, and to understand why we don’t move straight from the first show of promise in an animal study to using drugs on humans. There’s still a lot of animal data to gather, and human data to gather before anyone can tell if it’s safe or effective. I can’t tell you how many times animal studies don’t follow through to humans, but it’s one of the major attrition points in drug development. You’ve been through some of the unpredictability issues with Cladribine/Gilenya, where there was an interaction that wasn’t predicted. But once people try it, the doctors can see patterns and work out what’s going on. Clemastine/metformin is very exciting, and given what you’ve said about your current condition and your personal risk tolerance it makes sense to try it. It definitely wouldn’t be for everyone.   \n",

       "4  Hi everybody, My latest MRI results for Brain and Cervical Cord are in and my next Neurologist appointment is in the next couple of weeks. There’re no new lesions in Brain/Cord and I’ve had no relapses while I was on Gilenya. This was a good sign. But there was one line in the cervical cord review that concerned me. It goes : “Lesions at C2-3 and T2 now show hypointensity on the post gadolinium T1 images only. This could represent artifact or early axonal loss.” That was bothersome to read. What are the kind of symptoms from C2-C3 lesion should I be aware of ? Would it result in change of my DMT ? Thanks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "1  i can completely understand why you’d want to try it. but, results reported in lectures don’t always stand up to the scrutiny of peer-review during publication. there so much still to do before this is convincing. i hope that it does work out, i really do. and if you’re aware of and happy with the risks, then that’s great. i just think it’s important to present this in a balanced way, and to understand why we don’t move straight from the first show of promise in an animal study to using drugs on humans. there’s still a lot of animal data to gather, and human data to gather before anyone can tell if it’s safe or effective. i can’t tell you how many times animal studies don’t follow through to humans, but it’s one of the major attrition points in drug development. you’ve been through some of the unpredictability issues with cladribine/gilenya, where there was an interaction that wasn’t predicted. but once people try it, the doctors can see patterns and work out what’s going on. clemastine/metformin is very exciting, and given what you’ve said about your current condition and your personal risk tolerance it makes sense to try it. it definitely wouldn’t be for everyone.   \n",
       "2  interesting that it only targets s1p-1/5 receptors rather than 1-5 like fingolimod. hoping to soon see what the aes and saes were yes. i'm not sure what this means, exactly: quote nine patients reported serious adverse events (2 mg: 3/29 [10.3%], 1.25 mg: 1/43 [2.3%], 0.5 mg: 4/29 [13.8%], and 0.25 mg: 1/50 [2.0%]; no serious adverse event was reported for more than 1 patient and no new safety signals occurred compared with the bold study. if there were 9 patients reporting saes, how can it be stated that \"no serious adverse event was reported for more than 1 patient...\"? maybe i haven't read this right, or maybe there's a misprint. i'm very pleased that something is being developed for spms, and it's encouraging that siponimod doesn't linger for very long in the body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "2  interesting that it only targets s1p15 receptors rather than 15 like fingolimod hoping to soon see what the aes and saes were yes im not sure what this means exactly quote nine patients reported serious adverse events 2 mg 329 103 125 mg 143 23 05 mg 429 138 and 025 mg 150 20 no serious adverse event was reported for more than 1 patient and no new safety signals occurred compared with the bold study if there were 9 patients reporting saes how can it be stated that no serious adverse event was reported for more than 1 patient maybe i havent read this right or maybe theres a misprint im very pleased that something is being developed for spms and its encouraging that siponimod doesnt linger for very long in the body                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

There so much still to do before this is convincing. I hope that it does work out, I really do. And if you’re aware of and happy with the risks, then that’s great. I just think it’s important to present this in a balanced way, and to understand why we don’t move straight from the first show of promise in an animal study to using drugs on humans. There’s still a lot of animal data to gather, and human data to gather before anyone can tell if it’s safe or effective. I can’t tell you how many times animal studies don’t follow through to humans, but it’s one of the major attrition points in drug development. You’ve been through some of the unpredictability issues with Cladribine/Gilenya, where there was an interaction that wasn’t predicted. But once people try it, the doctors can see patterns and work out what’s going on. Clemastine/metformin is very exciting, and given what you’ve said about your current condition and your personal risk tolerance it makes sense to try it. It definitely wouldn’t be for everyone.</td>\n",

There’re no new lesions in Brain/Cord and I’ve had no relapses while I was on Gilenya. This was a good sign. But there was one line in the cervical cord review that concerned me. It goes : “Lesions at C2-3 and T2 now show hypointensity on the post gadolinium T1 images only. This could represent artifact or early axonal loss.” That was bothersome to read.

       "0  Autoimmune diseases tend to come in clusters. As for Gilenya – if you feel good, don’t think about it, it won’t change anything but waste your time and energy. I’m taking Tysabri and feel amazing, no symptoms (other than dodgy color vision, but I’ve had it since always, so, don’t know) and I don’t know if it will last a month, a year, a decade, ive just decided to enjoy the ride, no point in worrying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "1  I can completely understand why you’d want to try it. But, results reported in lectures don’t always stand up to the scrutiny of peer-review during publication. There so much still to do before this is convincing. I hope that it does work out, I really do. And if you’re aware of and happy with the risks, then that’s great. I just think it’s important to present this in a balanced way, and to understand why we don’t move straight from the first show of promise in an animal study to using drugs on humans. There’s still a lot of animal data to gather, and human data to gather before anyone can tell if it’s safe or effective. I can’t tell you how many times animal studies don’t follow through to humans, but it’s one of the major attrition points in drug development. You’ve been through some of the unpredictability issues with Cladribine/Gilenya, where there was an interaction that wasn’t predicted. But once people try it, the doctors can see patterns and work out what’s going on. Clemastine/metformin is very exciting, and given what you’ve said about your current condition and your personal risk tolerance it makes sense to try it. It definitely wouldn’t be for everyone.   \n",
       "2  Interesting that it only targets S1P-1/5 receptors rather than 1-5 like Fingolimod. Hoping to soon see what the AEs and SAEs were Yes. I'm not sure what this means, exactly:  Quote Nine patients reported serious adverse events (2 mg: 3/29 [10.3%], 1.25 mg: 1/43 [2.3%], 0.5 mg: 4/29 [13.8%], and 0.25 mg: 1/50 [2.0%]; no serious adverse event was reported for more than 1 patient and no new safety signals occurred compared with the BOLD Study. If there were 9 patients reporting SAEs, how can it be stated that \"no serious adverse event was reported for more than 1 patient...\"? Maybe I haven't read this right, or maybe there's a misprint. I'm very pleased that something is being developed for SPMS, and it's encouraging that siponimod doesn't linger for very long in the body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "4  Hi everybody, My latest MRI results for Brain and Cervical Cord are in and my next Neurologist appointment is in the next couple of weeks. There’re no new lesions in Brain/Cord and I’ve had no relapses while I was on Gilenya. This was a good sign. But there was one line in the cervical cord review that concerned me. It goes : “Lesions at C2-3 and T2 now show hypointensity on the post gadolinium T1 images only. This could represent artifact or early axonal loss.” That was bothersome to read. What are the kind of symptoms from C2-C3 lesion should I be aware of ? Would it result in change of my DMT ?

       "2  interesting that it only targets s1p-1/5 receptors rather than 1-5 like fingolimod. hoping to soon see what the aes and saes were yes. i'm not sure what this means, exactly: quote nine patients reported serious adverse events (2 mg: 3/29 [10.3%], 1.25 mg: 1/43 [2.3%], 0.5 mg: 4/29 [13.8%], and 0.25 mg: 1/50 [2.0%]; no serious adverse event was reported for more than 1 patient and no new safety signals occurred compared with the bold study. if there were 9 patients reporting saes, how can it be stated that \"no serious adverse event was reported for more than 1 patient...\"? maybe i haven't read this right, or maybe there's a misprint. i'm very pleased that something is being developed for spms, and it's encouraging that siponimod doesn't linger for very long in the body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "4  hi everybody, my latest mri results for brain and cervical cord are in and my next neurologist appointment is in the next couple of weeks. there’re no new lesions in brain/cord and i’ve had no relapses while i was on gilenya. this was a good sign. but there was one line in the cervical cord review that concerned me. it goes : “lesions at c2-3 and t2 now show hypointensity on the post gadolinium t1 images only. this could represent artifact or early axonal loss.” that was bothersome to read. what are the kind of symptoms from c2-c3 lesion should i be aware of ? would it result in change of my dmt ? thanks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "1  i can completely understand why you’d want to try it but results reported in lectures don’t always stand up to the scrutiny of peerreview during publication there so much still to do before this is convincing i hope that it does work out i really do and if you’re aware of and happy with the risks then that’s great i just think it’s important to present this in a balanced way and to understand why we don’t move straight from the first show of promise in an animal study to using drugs on humans there’s still a lot of animal data to gather and human data to gather before anyone can tell if it’s safe or effective i can’t tell you how many times animal studies don’t follow through to humans but it’s one of the major attrition points in drug development you’ve been through some of the unpredictability issues with cladribinegilenya where there was an interaction that wasn’t predicted but once people try it the doctors can see patterns and work out what’s going on clemastinemetformin is very exciting and given what you’ve said about your current condition and your personal risk tolerance it makes sense to try it it definitely wouldn’t be for everyone   \n",

There’re no new lesions in Brain/Cord and I’ve had no relapses while I was on Gilenya. This was a good sign. But there was one line in the cervical cord review that concerned me. It goes : “Lesions at C2-3 and T2 now show hypointensity on the post gadolinium T1 images only. This could represent artifact or early axonal loss.” That was bothersome to read. What are the kind of symptoms from C2-C3 lesion should I be aware of ? Would it result in change of my DMT ? Thanks.</td>\n",

       "0  Autoimmune diseases tend to come in clusters. As for Gilenya – if you feel good, don’t think about it, it won’t change anything but waste your time and energy. I’m taking Tysabri and feel amazing, no symptoms (other than dodgy color vision, but I’ve had it since always, so, don’t know) and I don’t know if it will last a month, a year, a decade, ive just decided to enjoy the ride, no point in worrying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "1  I can completely understand why you’d want to try it. But, results reported in lectures don’t always stand up to the scrutiny of peer-review during publication. There so much still to do before this is convincing. I hope that it does work out, I really do. And if you’re aware of and happy with the risks, then that’s great. I just think it’s important to present this in a balanced way, and to understand why we don’t move straight from the first show of promise in an animal study to using drugs on humans. There’s still a lot of animal data to gather, and human data to gather before anyone can tell if it’s safe or effective. I can’t tell you how many times animal studies don’t follow through to humans, but it’s one of the major attrition points in drug development. You’ve been through some of the unpredictability issues with Cladribine/Gilenya, where there was an interaction that wasn’t predicted. But once people try it, the doctors can see patterns and work out what’s going on. Clemastine/metformin is very exciting, and given what you’ve said about your current condition and your personal risk tolerance it makes sense to try it. It definitely wouldn’t be for everyone.   \n",
       "2  Interesting that it only targets S1P-1/5 receptors rather than 1-5 like Fingolimod. Hoping to soon see what the AEs and SAEs were Yes. I'm not sure what this means, exactly:  Quote Nine patients reported serious adverse events (2 mg: 3/29 [10.3%], 1.25 mg: 1/43 [2.3%], 0.5 mg: 4/29 [13.8%], and 0.25 mg: 1/50 [2.0%]; no serious adverse event was reported for more than 1 patient and no new safety signals occurred compared with the BOLD Study. If there were 9 patients reporting SAEs, how can it be stated that \"no serious adverse event was reported for more than 1 patient...\"? Maybe I haven't read this right, or maybe there's a misprint. I'm very pleased that something is being developed for SPMS, and it's encouraging that siponimod doesn't linger for very long in the body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "4  Hi everybody, My latest MRI results for Brain and Cervical Cord are in and my next Neurologist appointment is in the next couple of weeks. There’re no new lesions in Brain/Cord and I’ve had no relapses while I was on Gilenya. This was a good sign. But there was one line in the cervical cord review that concerned me. It goes : “Lesions at C2-3 and T2 now show hypointensity on the post gadolinium T1 images only. This could represent artifact or early axonal loss.” That was bothersome to read. What are the kind of symptoms from C2-C3 lesion should I be aware of ? Would it result in change of my DMT ?

       "1  i can completely understand why you’d want to try it. but, results reported in lectures don’t always stand up to the scrutiny of peer-review during publication. there so much still to do before this is convincing. i hope that it does work out, i really do. and if you’re aware of and happy with the risks, then that’s great. i just think it’s important to present this in a balanced way, and to understand why we don’t move straight from the first show of promise in an animal study to using drugs on humans. there’s still a lot of animal data to gather, and human data to gather before anyone can tell if it’s safe or effective. i can’t tell you how many times animal studies don’t follow through to humans, but it’s one of the major attrition points in drug development. you’ve been through some of the unpredictability issues with cladribine/gilenya, where there was an interaction that wasn’t predicted. but once people try it, the doctors can see patterns and work out what’s going on. clemastine/metformin is very exciting, and given what you’ve said about your current condition and your personal risk tolerance it makes sense to try it. it definitely wouldn’t be for everyone.   \n",

       "2  interesting that it only targets s1p15 receptors rather than 15 like fingolimod hoping to soon see what the aes and saes were yes im not sure what this means exactly quote nine patients reported serious adverse events 2 mg 329 103 125 mg 143 23 05 mg 429 138 and 025 mg 150 20 no serious adverse event was reported for more than 1 patient and no new safety signals occurred compared with the bold study if there were 9 patients reporting saes how can it be stated that no serious adverse event was reported for more than 1 patient maybe i havent read this right or maybe theres a misprint im very pleased that something is being developed for spms and its encouraging that siponimod doesnt linger for very long in the body                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
