    "Nowadays the narrative of a brand is not only built and controlled by the company that owns the brand. For this reason, companies are constantly looking out across Blogs, Forums, and other social media platforms, etc for checking the sentiment for their various products and also competitor products to learn how their brand resonates in the market. This kind of analysis helps them as part of their post-launch market research. This is relevant for a lot of industries including pharma and their drugs.\n",

    "*Stelara is still fairly new to Crohn's treatment. This is why you might not get a lot of replies. I've done some research, but most of the \"time to work\" answers are from Psoriasis boards. For Psoriasis, it seems to be about 4-12 weeks to reach a strong therapeutic level. The good news is, Stelara seems to be getting rave reviews from Crohn's patients. It seems to be the best med to come along since Remicade. I hope you have good success with it. My daughter was diagnosed Feb. 19/07, (13 yrs. old at the time of diagnosis), with Crohn's of the Terminal Illium. Has used Prednisone and Pentasa. Started Imuran (02/09), had an abdominal abscess (12/08). 2cm of Stricture. Started ​Remicade in Feb. 2014, along with 100mgs. of Imuran.*\n",

It goes : “Lesions at C2-3 and T2 now show hypointensity on the post gadolinium T1 images only. This could represent artifact or early axonal loss.” That was bothersome to read.

I'm not sure what this means, exactly:  Quote Nine patients reported serious adverse events (2 mg: 3/29 [10.3%], 1.25 mg: 1/43 [2.3%], 0.5 mg: 4/29 [13.8%], and 0.25 mg: 1/50 [2.0%]; no serious adverse event was reported for more than 1 patient and no new safety signals occurred compared with the BOLD Study. If there were 9 patients reporting SAEs, how can it be stated that \"no serious adverse event was reported for more than 1 patient...\"? Maybe I haven't read this right, or maybe there's a misprint. I'm very pleased that something is being developed for SPMS, and it's encouraging that siponimod doesn't linger for very long in the body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "4  Hi everybody, My latest MRI results for Brain and Cervical Cord are in and my next Neurologist appointment is in the next couple of weeks. There’re no new lesions in Brain/Cord and I’ve had no relapses while I was on Gilenya. This was a good sign. But there was one line in the cervical cord review that concerned me. It goes : “Lesions at C2-3 and T2 now show hypointensity on the post gadolinium T1 images only. This could represent artifact or early axonal loss.” That was bothersome to read. What are the kind of symptoms from C2-C3 lesion should I be aware of ? Would it result in change of my DMT ? Thanks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
